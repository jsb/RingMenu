# RingMenu
This AddOn for Classic WoW (v. 1.13) adds an additional circular action bar that normally remains hidden but can be summoned by a click of a (mouse) button.

The RingMenu is hence ideal for storing away action buttons that are frequently used yet need not be present on the screen at all times (e.g. trade skills, tracking spells, hearthstone, etc.).

**Note**: RingMenu for Classic WoW is still in Beta. Some features (e.g. animations) are currently missing.

## Setup
Before first use, you need to set up a button to summon / dismiss the RingMenu anywhere on the screen. Go to  
**Main Menu** > **Key Bindings** > **Other** > **RingMenu** > **Toggle RingMenu**  
and choose an appropriate button. This can be any keyboard or mouse button (e.g. middle mouse button).

Open the RingMenu by clicking the summon button anywhere on the screen. You can now drag and drop actions to the slots of the RingMenu like for a regular action bar.

## Configuration
Open the settings panel by going to **Main Menu** > **Interface Options** > **AddOns** > **RingMenu**.

Using the _First Button Slot_ and _Number of Buttons_ settings, you can adjust the range of action button slots that are used for the RingMenu. Depending on your class, some button slot ranges might be already in use for shapeshift forms. Use [this list](http://wowwiki.wikia.com/wiki/ActionSlot) to pick an appropriate range.
